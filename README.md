# Kelly_et_al_traits_to_demog_2020

Code and data files required for the analysis presented in the paper - Environmental and evolutionary context are required to infer plant life-history strategies from functional traits, are contained in this repo. 

There are two main stages in this, 

    -  The calculation of the Life History metrics from the Compadre database,
       and it's linkage to the functional traits databases.
    -  Attaching the environmental and phylogenetic data to this data. 
    
These are stored in the folders - "1_Calculating_Life_History_Metrics" and   "2_Joining_Env_Phylo_and_GLMMing" respectively.  

Inside each of these folders there is a file called overview code, this is an rmarkdown file that describes and runs all of the analyses in that folder. 

I have also added a third folder 3 - Working_with_glmm_outputs, this folder contains a few bits of code that were used after the fitting of the main multiple response model presented in the paper. Relating to model variance calculation and some plotting.
